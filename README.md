# Game of Life Maven Spring FXML

This application displays an interactive animation of Conway's Game of Life, where opposite sides of the board are glued together (periodic boundary conditions). Features include randomization of the board's configuration, variable frame rate and manual iteration of the board with more in the planing.

The author created this project to practice concepts of clean and structured code and learn frameworks such as Maven, Spring and JavaFX. As such, the interface is kepts practical and the functionality limited (or slowly growing).
